## Querying NRDD Data
Use this code to filter NRDD data by its attributes and search terms. Given the large number of NRDD Data Fields and the many Line Offices, Programs, and Labs that contribute, the process of querying can vary by each user. The code has been formatted into a very general format so that the user can customize as needed to pull information.

There is a sample .xlsx file that contains some search words to help users get started on querying data by topic areas.
